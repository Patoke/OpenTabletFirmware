# OpenTabletFirmware

Currently a clean room decompilation project that aims at rebuilding the source code for the Gaomon M10K Pro tablet

The goal is to expand this project to support other tablets and MCUs in the Gaomon and Huion lineups, and hopefully eventually support all major tablet manufacturers

I aim for this project to get rid of firmware limitations hardcoded into Gaomon and Huion tablets, this way utilizing all the resources these tablets have to offer in terms of polling rate, pen support, smoothing, sampling, etc...

TODO list:

* How to flash firmware?
* How to use the compiled binaries?
* How to compile?
* How to patch firmware for unsupported tablets? (remove hardware smoothing, boost polling rates, common/shared patches, etc...)
* Requirements
* Credits
* Basically everything... Remember to make it as cool as possible
